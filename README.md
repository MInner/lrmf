# Log-Likelihood Ratio Minimizing Flows: Towards Robust and Quantifiable Neural Distribution Alignment

We introduce a new adversarial log-likelihood ratio domain alignment objective, show how to upper-bound it with a simple stable minimization objective, if the domain transformation is a normalizing flow, and show its relation to Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence and GANs.

> Distribution alignment has many applications in deep learning, including domain adaptation and unsupervised image-to-image translation. Most prior work on unsupervised distribution alignment relies either on minimizing simple non-parametric statistical distances such as maximum mean discrepancy or on adversarial alignment. However, the former fails to capture the structure of complex real-world distributions, while the latter is difficult to train and does not provide any universal convergence guarantees or automatic quantitative validation procedures. In this paper, we propose a new distribution alignment method based on a log-likelihood ratio statistic and normalizing flows. We show that, under certain assumptions, this combination yields a deep neural likelihood-based minimization objective that attains a known lower bound upon convergence. We experimentally verify that minimizing the resulting objective results in domain alignment that preserves the local structure of input domains.
